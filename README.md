# The Z3-TurnKey Distribution

[The Z3 Theorem Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/) is a widely used SMT solver that is written
in C and C++. The authors provide a Java API, however, it expects the user to install native
libraries for their platform. This precludes easy usage of the solver as, e.g., a Maven dependency.

This project packages the Z3 Java API and native libraries for all supported platforms as a
[TurnKey bundle](https://github.com/tudo-aqua/turnkey-support). At runtime, the correct library for
the platform is extracted and automatically loaded. The libraries themselves are modified to support
this paradigm.

At the moment, platform support is as follows:

| Operating System | x86 | AMD64 | AARCH64 |
| ---------------- | :-: | :---: | :-----: |
| Linux            |     |   ✓   |         |
| macOS            |     |   ✓   |    ✓    |
| Windows          |  ✓  |   ✓   |         |

## Usage

The library can be included as a regular Maven dependency from the Maven Central repository. See the
page for your version of choice [there](https://search.maven.org/artifact/tools.aqua/z3-turnkey) for
configuration snippets for most build tools.

## Building

Building the library requires multiple native tools to be installed that can not be installed using
Gradle:

- For library rewriting, see the tools required by the
  [turnkey-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/tudo-aqua/turnkey-gradle-plugin).
- Additionally, Python 3 is required for a code generation step and localized by the
  [gradle-use-python-plugin](https://github.com/xvik/gradle-use-python-plugin).

## Java and JPMS Support

The library requires Java 8. It can be used as a Java module on Java 9+ via the multi-release JAR
mechanism as the `tools.aqua.turnkey.z3` module.
